Memory Expansion Experiment
In this experiment the experience replay memory of the agent was heavily expanded with 
memories of different scenarios. First the agent was trained in a scenario with only 
the 2 Cacodemons. All experience replay memory from learning this task was preserved. 
Next the agent was trained in a scenario with only WolfensteinSS. All experience replay 
memory from learning this task was also preserved. Finally the agent would be trained on 
the challenge. Experience replay would be run on each of the preserved memories alongside 
the agent's own memory.
